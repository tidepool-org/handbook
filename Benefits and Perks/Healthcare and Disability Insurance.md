# Healthcare, Disability Insurance and other benefits.

The following applies to full-time U.S.-based employees.

Tidepool's priorities with benefits are wellness and education, so it’s important that we offer our employees great medical coverage and disability insurance. Because of our mission, many of our employees have a personal connection to a chronic illness. Therefore, we strive to provide a full-featured health plan that mimimizes deductables and out-of-pocket expenses and avoids lifetime caps.

We offer medical, dental, and vision coverage at Tidepool for full-time U.S.-based employees and their dependents. All full-time US employees receive Short Term Disability Insurance and Long Term Disability Insurance.

Our current medical plan is provided through Blue Shield of California:
* Plan name: Platinum Full PPO 0/10 OffEx
* Calendar Year Medical Deductible: $0
* Calendar Year Out of Pocket Maximum:
    * Participating providers: $2,500 per individual / $5,000 per family
    * Non-participating providers: $5,000 per individual / $10,000 per family
* Lifetime Benefit Maximum: None

Employees are also eligible to participate in a Flexible Spending Account (FSA). Tidepool will match contributions to the FSA dollor-for-dollar up to $2500.

Employees may contribute to a 401(k) retirement savings plan. Tidepool currently does not offer contribution matching.
