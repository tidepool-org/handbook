# Tidepool Likely Holiday List


Tidepool employs people around the world. This list of US Holidays is presented as general guidance of the days that US-based employees will likely take off. However, some people may choose to work, and international employees may take different days off.

Like our vacation non-policy, the guidance is: We trust you. There is no policy.
