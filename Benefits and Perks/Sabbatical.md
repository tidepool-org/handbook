# Sabbatical

After every 4 years of working at Tidepool, full-time employees and contractors are encouraged to take four weeks of paid sabbatical.

During this sabbatical, you should work on passion projects - something outside the scope of your normal work that is interesting and exciting to you. This could be researching a topic of interest, volunteering for another nonprofit, or something else altogether.

The sabbatical should be a time of self-improvement and exploration with a central activity or theme. At the end of the sabbatical, you  should put together a presentation about their sabbatical and present it to the team.

The sabbatical is meant to help further our core value of improvement by letting the employees explore and learn about another area of interest. It may also help some employees avoid burnout from working on one thing for too long.

To make sure that sabbatical is not overly disruptive to the team, you should plan the time for your sabbatical well in advance.

There is an expectation that employees return to work at Tidepool after your sabbatical, and that you will not use it as a soft exit from the company.

Paid time off of any kind, including Sabbatical, does not accrue.
