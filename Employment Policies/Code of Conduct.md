# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct applies to all community members (e.g., open source contributors and other volunteers) and Tidepool team members in all Tidepool communities online (including but not limited to Tidepool's internal and external Slack groups, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram), while working in the Tidepool office or remotely, at all events hosted by Tidepool, at diabetes community and industry events attended by a Tidepool employee, whether or not directly representing Tidepool.

Tidepool is dedicated to creating an inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, color, sex (with or without sexual conduct and including pregnancy and sexual orientation involving transgender status/gender identity, and sex-stereotyping), national origin, age, disability (physical or mental), genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, marital status, and political affiliation as well as gender expression, medical condition, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, computing experience, or clothing.

We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to the protected classes above, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Harassment does not need to be recognized as unwanted or unwelcome by anyone other than the person being harassed.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Offensive jokes are not appropriate and will not be tolerated under any circumstance. Consider that calling attention to differences can feel alienating.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Community members violating these rules may be sanctioned or removed from community spaces. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the CEO, a VP or a member of the Board of Directors immediately.
