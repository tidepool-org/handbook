# Compensation

The following policy applies to U.S. employees and all full-time contractors.

## Salary

Fair compensation is critical to making Tidepool a desirable place to work and helping our employees lead happy, healthy lives inside and outside of the office. When used as a motivational tool, though, it can incentivize the wrong kind of optimizations. Our goal with salary is that it checks the box of "enough" for folks who are excited about working at Tidepool (because of our mission, people and products) and then fades into the background.

As a non-profit, and as a startup trying to extend our financial operating runway as long as possible, we ask people to let us know what is the lowest salary that they feel is fair compensation for their work, but that won't put them into a situation of going into debt or not being able to pay the bills.

Tidepool evaluates compensation annually. Our ability to offer raises is dependent on our current financial situation.

## Bonuses

Tidepool does not currently give bonuses for any reason.

## Equity

As a California non-profit corporation, Tidepool has no equity investors, and does not award stock or stock options.
